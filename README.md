# MyAnimeListToCSV

This small project fetches your anime or manga list from MyAnimeList and returns a CSV file that you can use on Microsoft Excel, for example. Analyse it the way MAL doesn't!

## For the future

- Expand to other platforms (AniList, AnimePlanet, etc.)
- Provide more detailed explanations on each request error code
